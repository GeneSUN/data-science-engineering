**Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**
- https://bayesball.github.io/BOOK/bayesian-hierarchical-modeling.html

**Predict a distribution, not just a mean (so exceedance is easy + uncertainty is honest)**


The advantage in cold start is that the model can naturally output wider uncertainty when the input is out-of-distribution or data-sparse.
[Calibrated Prediction with Covariate Shift via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation]

**Handle distribution shift explicitly (new market often = covariate shift)**


**Similarity-based priors: “find similar markets/lanes” and shrink to them**
