# Hierarchical Modeling for Predicting Song Popularity

This README summarizes a practical framework for predicting the popularity of a specific artist’s next song using **complete pooling, no pooling, and hierarchical (partial pooling) models**.

The focus is on hierarchical modeling (Bayesian multilevel ANOVA style), which balances artist-specific information with population-level information.

**Goal**

Predict the **next-song popularity** for:

- A **known artist** (we have past songs)
- An **unseen artist** (no past songs)

---

**Modeling Strategies**

## 1️⃣ Complete Pooling

<details>

### Assumption
All songs are exchangeable. Artist identity is ignored.

### Model
$$
Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

### Prediction
Every artist gets the same prediction centered at the global mean.

### Pros
✅ Simple  
✅ Good for estimating “average song overall”

### Cons
❌ Ignores artist differences  
❌ Beyoncé ≈ unknown artist

</details>

## 2️⃣ No Pooling

<details>
### Assumption
Each artist is totally independent.

### Model
$$
Y_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \sigma^2)
$$

### Prediction
Each artist’s prediction is centered near their sample mean.

### Pros
✅ Captures artist differences

### Cons
❌ Unstable when artist has few songs  
❌ Overfits noise  
❌ Cannot predict unseen artists

</details>

## 3️⃣ Hierarchical / Partial Pooling ✅ (Recommended)

<details>

### Core Idea
Artists differ, but they come from a shared population.

We **borrow strength across artists**.

## Model Structure

### Layer 1 — Within-Artist Model


  
Songs vary around the artist’s mean:

$$
Y_{ij} \mid \mu_j, \sigma_{within}
\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \sigma_{within}^2)
$$

- $$\mu_j$$: artist-specific mean  
- $$\sigma_{within}$$: shared within-artist variability



### Layer 2 — Between-Artist Model


  
Artist means vary around a global mean:

$$
\mu_j \mid \mu, \sigma_{between}
\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma_{between}^2)
$$

- $$\mu$$: global mean popularity  
- $$\sigma_{between}$$: between-artist variability


### Layer 3 — Priors

  
Priors on global parameters:

$$
\mu,\ \sigma_{within},\ \sigma_{between}
$$



**Prediction Framework**

## Case A — Known Artist

<details> <summary> </summary>
  
### Step 1: Estimate Artist Mean (Shrinkage)

Posterior mean behaves like:

$$E[\mu_j \mid data]\approx w_j \bar y_j + (1-w_j)\mu$$

Where:
- small $$n_j$$ → more shrinkage to global mean  
- large $$n_j$$ → closer to artist mean

This is **borrowing information from the population**.



### Step 2: Predict Next Song



  $$Y_{new,j}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \sigma_{within}^2)$$


### Step 3: Sources of Uncertainty

1) Song-to-song randomness  
2) Uncertainty in $$\mu_j$$

## Case B — Unseen Artist

<details>

### whatever

Extra step required.

### Step 1: Sample Artist Mean

$$\mu_{new} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma_{between}^2)$$

### Step 2: Sample Song Popularity

$$Y_{new}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{new}, \sigma_{within}^2)$$



### Uncertainty Sources

- Within-artist variability  
- Between-artist variability  
- Posterior uncertainty in global parameters

Predictions are wider than for known artists.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways


Hierarchical models estimate artist-specific means that are **shrunk toward a global mean**, then predict future songs using shared within-artist variability while accounting for uncertainty.


### Complete Pooling
Good for global average, bad for individuals.

### No Pooling
Good for large-sample artists, risky for small samples.

### Hierarchical Pooling
Best balance:
- Uses artist data  
- Stabilizes small samples  
- Predicts unseen artists  
- Shares information intelligently
